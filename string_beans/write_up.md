# StringBeans WriteUp

First download the file and navigate in the terminal to the appropriate folder,

 Run the following command:
`strings string_beans.png`

The strings command outputs a list of all of the printable character strings in the file (see [man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/strings.html](man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/strings.html) for more information). When you look at the last string that is outputted, you see the string "Intake24{yummy_beans}" which is the flag for this challenge.
